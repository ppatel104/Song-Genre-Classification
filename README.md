## Song Genre Classification Based on Lyric Analysis
## Team:
### 1) Purvank Patel
### 2) Sarthak Anand
### 3) karthik Prakash
## We have used different features such as tf-idf based cosine similarity, pos tags, and word2vec to classify songs into different genres based on their lyrics. We have tried Logistic Regression, Neural Network, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.
